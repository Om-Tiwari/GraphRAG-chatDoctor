I have gone through what you have mentioned and understand your anxiety about your son\\s eyesight. - 11D and - 8D are high myopic powers and the chances are that the power may progress as your son is still young. My advice to you is: 1. Avoid reading or holding objects very near to the eye. This will cause myopia to progress faster and will worsen the condition. 2. Every six monthly visits or follow up visits as per doctors advise. Since the myopia is of a high degree, there will be excessive stretching and degeneration of the structures of the eyeball. This can cause problems such as retinal detachment. Regular follow-ups help us in picking up changes faster and in preventing such complications as retinal detachment. 3. Ask your son to regularly self-check his vision. This is done by closing each eye one at a time and observing how a particular object or letter looks.

Trench mouth or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) is a bacterial infection and is uncommon nowadays but it is highly associated with HIV infection and in kids with nutritional deficiencies. To be diagnosed with trench mouth or ANUG, symptoms like gum necrosis and ulceration, pain and bleeding (on just touching the gums) should be present. The main characteristic feature is fetid or the putrid odor which is caused due to the rotting gum tissue. And people diagnosed with ANUG has this odor, unless if they are under treatment in a very initial stage. It is certainly difficult for people with ANUG to eat a portion of normal or even less spicy food if they are not under treatment. It is treatable within a week by the usual antibiotic regimen and medicated mouth rinses. Gum infection such as this cannot occur only by fellatio.

The doctor might have given for some time but it has to be stopped now. Warfarin is given for stroke prevention. 5 mg is a minimal dose. It cannot be removed as stroke prevention is essential. Timing can be made flexible. Atorvastatin is for heart attack prevention. Ideally can be taken at bedtime. Frusemide is a diuretic. There is no specific reason to give this in your case.

I have gone through your lab reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and they are consistent with the diagnosis made by your doctor.Yellowish tint of the eyes is due to increased bilirubin levels.

It is understandable that you are feeling weak since your body is producing red blood cells at an accelerated rate to compensate for the destruction occurring in the spleen. This is also the reason why your spleen is enlarged. If your condition worsens, your doctor might suggest a splenectomy. This will not cure the condition but will relieve the symptoms since the site of destruction of red blood cells will be removed and your red blood cells will be able to survive for a longer period in the blood. Splenectomy, however, can predispose one to certain bacterial infections and it is important that you receive the appropriate vaccines regularly. You could take folic acid and vitamin B12 supplements since one of your blood tests show macrocytic anemia. For more information consult a hematologist online "}]}

I look forward to your response and suggestions."}], "ideal": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. This can be a cardiac arrhythmia like PSVT (paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia) or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. And one may get symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain or heaviness, dizziness, etc. Are you having ventricular or atrial ectopics? Have you undergone echo? Presence of ectopics also suggests the possibility of these arrhythmias. Usually, ECG is normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity) as it is done in between the episodes or may show ectopics. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You may request for portable cardiac monitor either Holter or another mobile-based rhythm monitor especially during intercourse to see the rhythm is recurring. Alternatively, you may undergo treadmill test and we can see if it recurs during the running.  Also, thyroid test should be done if not had recently. ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Next time, you have this, focus on heart rate and measure pulse rate. These arrhythmias are not life-threatening. So overall, that episode may be an episode atrial arrhythmia rather than panic attack and our priority is to confirm it by investigations.

Muscle tension dysphonia occurs due to various reasons and can be present after laryngitis or pneumonia as in your case. As an ENT surgeon, I would like to see the laryngoscopy video myself to ascertain if indeed the false vocal cords are producing voice instead of the true ones. Dysphonia plica ventricularis is the grade 2 of muscle tension dysphonia. Dysphonia plica ventricularis is when the false cords medialize to produce voice. Continue the speech therapy and anti-reflux treatment like your ENT surgeon and audiologist has prescribed. The speech therapy is aimed at suppressing maladaptive phonatory mechanisms and learn techniques designed to minimize muscular tension.

STIs are the diseases that are typically transmitted during sexual intercourse. It is unlikely to catch sexually transmitted infections with kissing alone, but with a few exceptions if the STI has manifested itself orally and/or in oral fluid of that person. Hepatitis B virus can be transmitted through kissing as the virus is found in saliva and other body secretions of HBV infected person. Herpes infection- This can be transmitted through kissing with a person who has a visible cold sore. Human papillomavirus (HPV) or warts and syphilis are less likely to be transmitted through kissing. So far, there is no reported case of HIV transmission through kissing.  Take care."}]}

To answer, let me explain to you how a nerve grows. It takes one month of latency and later nerve grows at 1 mm per day. Even though the nerve might reach your muscle, for bulk to improve, it takes another few months. For one to determine if the nerve signals have improved, you can get an electromyography to see for any improvement. Decompression will improve sensation very fast and then power. But for muscle bulk, it usually takes a while for muscle transfer to be suitable. In case, you have any form of weakness and never to fill up a cosmetic defect such as hypothenar flatness, for that one can consider fat grafting. If the bulk does not improve after six months. I would advise you to wait as it usually takes longer than 14 weeks. If you want to see and have proof of progress go for EMG.

The procedure which you mentioned is called as orthognathic surgery which is done if there is a skeletal malrelation between the two jaws which cannot be corrected by orthodontics alone.

I am visiting a hospital frequently as I have iron deficiency anemia. The thing I am scared about is, my doctor asked me why my ferritin has not increased (just the opposite, it has decreased from 5.79 to 5.77) after three months of taking iron supplements. My other iron levels are at 39 which has increased considering those references. But, that was probably because I did not use the medicine correctly, I was only taking 5 mg a day. Another thing I am worried about is, my lymphocytes kind of got increased in my blood: (52.8) - the reference is 19.4 to 44.9, and the other one is 3.57. My neutrophils kind of decreased too (36.9) and the reference was between 41.0 to 73.0.In the last week, I had a viral infection as both my parents were sick. Is it why my levels got high?

Honestly, I have been always getting suspected about it since my anemia has started. Should I be worried about my condition or is it normal?"}], "ideal": "Hello. In viral infection, lymphocytosis means increased lymphocytes and neutrophil is relatively low because of increased lymphocytes. Platelet can be high in iron deficiency anemia. It is not a matter of worry just now. You can provide your reports to guide you further. Your hemoglobin level is mildly low and you should be given a good iron-containing medication like Ferrous ascorbate (brand name Orofer that contains 100 mg elemental iron). It should be taken without break for the prescribed duration. The underlying cause for iron deficiency anemia also should be ruled out like bleeding, parasites infestation, etc. Repeat your CBC after a few days.

Please help. I am very concerned."}], "ideal": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. If symptoms are too severe we can go for tonsil and adenoid surgery now also. Flonase is a steroid and it does not affect growth as it will be administered inside the nostril and will have the action only there. There will not be any systemic or bloodstream absorption. How much worried you should be about his tonsil and sleep apnea problem are: 1. Change in facial features producing adenoid facies. 2. Irritability of kid. 3. He cannot hear properly due to adenoids blocking ear tubes. 4. Ear discharge. 5. Reduced development of speech. Do not get worried just because of the snoring and sleep apnea. Give him nasal steroids and antihistaminic syrup (like Zyrtec or Allegra syrup) of appropriate dosage. In some cases, we even give oral steroid syrup. It does not cause any stunting the way you have understood. Once you exhaust the above medical treatment option and find no or not much benefit we can discuss about the surgery. Your doctor is right in giving the medicines Flonase, etc. That is the protocol. We can follow the same here. The decision to operate may vary with different surgeon. Take a pediatrician opinion as well. Do revert back to me if you need more support. "}]}

My height is 187 cm and weight is 102 kg."}], "ideal": "Hi. I can understand your situation. Premature ejaculation is not a disease of the body and it is seen in almost all men at some point. It occurs because of your tension and anxiety about performing sex or previous bad sexual experiences. Medicines can be taken initially to reduce your anxiety if you are married or having regular sex.  Practicing exercises to strengthen the muscles which help in ejaculation and retraining penis to ejaculate late would be a permanent solution rather than medicine. No permanent cure with allopathy, ayurveda or any system. It happens because of so many factors like as follows: 1. You have been training your penis to ejaculate early all these days. 2. You will be very anxious about losing the erection and will hurry up for intercourse. 3. Glans of the penis may be very sensitive. 4. The desire may be too much.

Please help."}], "ideal": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I am assuming that you have regular monthly periods. In that case, it is the time where you are going to ovulate. So, it is an unsafe period to have sex. And, if you have once unprotected sex and have taken I-pill (emergency contraceptive pill) once, then why to make mistake for the second time. Because, I-pill in itself is not 100% effective even if taken once. There is no study about two times taken I-pill. It works with two mechanisms. First of all, it will delay ovulation and second, it brings bleeding. So, if pregnancy happens, it resists implantation. In your case, if I believe that ovulation is delayed while you have taken the tablet, then it is good. If you have taken the tablet for the second time, then the ovulation is more delayed and period will be somewhat late with more chance of avoiding pregnancy. The second thing is that with I-pill your period cycle can become irregular. The chance of that increases more if you have taken two times. Because, it is a chemical (hormone), which is produced in your body to maintain your regular cycle. And, when you take it from outside it can disturb your normal cycle. If you do not want pregnancy in the first place, then either use condom or other method as preferred by you both after discussing with your doctor. I-pill is an emergency contraceptive and not a regular contraceptive pill that you can take as and when required. It should be taken when fear of failure of normal contraception is more. So, make the thing clear about whether you want pregnancy or not and go for a solution which helps you in future. "}]}

It is fine to have taken it a few hours late as long as she has not skipped the pill that day. There is no need to take an additional pill if she has not missed the day\\s pill. If the pills were started a week before the intercourse and she has taken them daily and not missed a single pill, the effectiveness in preventing a pregnancy is about 99 percent.

Your symptoms are mostly dizziness, which worsens with sudden eye movements or body movements, and are sometimes associated with headaches. Based on the symptoms, the most common cause in your age group is a vestibular migraine or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). I assume you do not have any other risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, previous stroke or diagnosis of epilepsy. A simple neurological exam using Dix Hallpike Maneuver can help differentiate between BPPV and vestibular migraine. Also, further questions on the quality of headache, location and associated symptoms such as light sensitivity, loud noise sensitivity and nausea are other important questions, that can happen with vestibular migraine. Treatment for BPPV is physiotherapy with some specific exercises and medicines such as Topiramate or Valproic acid for vestibular migraine. If there are any red flags on neurological exam, then an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain would be needed. Please do not hesitate to ask me any other questions. Take care.

During these all 8 years I have had several UTIs with some leading to severe kidney infections. Last week after almost two years of not having a UTI I felt the horrible symptoms again. When going to the doctors UTI urine test came back positive. The doctor prescribed me seven days Nitrofurantoin antibiotics which cleared the pain and seemed gone entirely. Unfortunately two days later, the symptoms came back (please note that I had sex with my partner the day before) with burning sensation when urinating and painful when standing with the need to go toilet every 2 to 3 minutes. I went back to the clinic the same day to get it checked and take more antibiotics.But to my surprise, the urine test came back clear for UTI, and my symptoms disappeared. Then the doctor advised me to get tested for Chlamydia as the symptoms can sometimes be mistaken to be UTI. I have been diagnosed with Chlamydia at the beginning of this same relationship and was treated for it. My partner was also tested, but his results came back negative. Is it possible that the treatment that I had for Chlamydia 8 years ago did not clear it entirely and this lead to several UTIs and kidney infections? And also, would the antibiotics for UTI clear Chlamydia? Thank you in advance for your help."}], "ideal": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. In UTI, initially, a broad-spectrum empirical antibiotic given and then according to urine culture report, a specific antibiotic prescribed. A certain antibiotic like Azithromycin if prescribed for UTI will be effective against chlamydia as well. For chlamydia, Azithromycin is an effective  ChatDoctor.  If chlamydia infection present recently then some irritation, itching, discharge like complaint present and swab culture can be done for that if needed.

As you can see I am so scared for my throat to close up that I am scared to eat anything. I have only been eating a couple of things daily and live off that."}], "ideal": "Hello,  Welcome to ChatDoctor. RAST is a highly accurate test. If the test is positive for a specific allergen, it shows that you are sensitized to that particular allergen. This means that you may mount an allergic response when you are exposed to that allergen. However, it does not mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to that substance and, nor does it mean that any reactions will be severe. If the test is negative, it means that one does not have the ability to mount an allergic reaction to that allergen and any symptoms one may be experiencing are probably not due to an allergic reaction to that substance. However, the results of the RAST need to be interpreted in conjunction with your clinical history. e.g the presence of allergy to some or few allergens which may possibly be present either in the environment or food does not necessarily mean that they are responsible for the symptoms because if they are not even present in the environment or food of an individual, then they are irrelevant. In your case, an elimination diet has not helped thus proving the fact that RAST test results should be carefully interpreted along with clinical history and does not necessarily mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to the substance that you tested. Angioedema is frequently associated with urticaria. Pathogenesis is the same for both urticaria as well as angioedema. The presence of angioedema does not always mean that it is a part of anaphylaxis. Angioedema can be a part of anaphylaxis in those individuals who have a severe allergic reaction to an allergen with high levels of antibodies circulating in the blood. Since you have only class 1 and 2 level antibodies therefore it is unlike that these antigens or allergens would cause anaphylaxis. "}]}

The redness you are referring to is the erythmatous tissue that generally occurs post cleaning because the gums while cleaning gets separated from the tooth structure (like an injury).

Most of them advise liver function tests after two weeks to see if the dose is not giving you side effects. But that can usually be followed up with rheumatology nurse.

I read your query, and it seems that the bump which is painful and which gives radiating pain to ear and head is because of your third molar and this tooth is infected as the food gets entrapped between the tooth and soft tissue covering that tooth. For this, avoid eating too hot or too cold. Wash out oral cavity after every meal with mouthwash and warm saline. Do not apply external heat to that area, especially keeping your hand on that area. Also, take antibiotic and painkiller. Antibiotic you can use is Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid combination in 625 mg dosage bd. Painkiller can be Ultracet ((tramadol and acetaminophen) thrice a day.

When it happened, the color of the tooth changed very slightly, to a very slightly more yellow shade than the rest of my teeth. I am curious to know what happened when the trauma occurred. Did my tooth die? What are they checking for when they x-ray the tooth?"}], "ideal": "Hello. I have been through your query and can understand your concern. Any trauma to the tooth generally has long-term consequences like tooth discoloration, etc. As you said that your tooth was fractured, it might have led to a slight injury to the pulp or even if not so, the fracture line would have been close to the pulp. In both cases, the pulp over time starts to become non-vital sometimes due to injury and sometimes due to the restorative material lying in close proximity to the pulp. This over time results in the discoloration of the tooth. The characteristic feature of this discoloration will be that only the involved tooth will be discolored and other teeth will be normal or not discolored. If that is the case, it generally means that the tooth is in the process of becoming non-vital till the tooth becomes slight brownish black which means the tooth is entirely non-vital. It is generally not associated with any kind of pain as the process is chronic and takes time to set in. I would advise you to have a visit to your nearest dentist. He would prescribe a vitality test of the tooth and also would get an x-ray for the tooth. By that way, he would come to know if the tooth is dead or still vital and accordingly will propose treatment. If the tooth is vital, he will put some medication over the pulp to let it heal and then fill with the pulp friendly restoration. However, if the tooth is dead, I would suggest you to go for the root canal treatment (after evaluating the condition of the tooth and soft tissue). Meanwhile, keep your oral hygiene good, brush twice daily and floss regularly. Use mouth rinses to clean the mouth after meals. "}]}

Please tell me do you have any relevant history? Dental procedures that involve the use of dental burs can cause tinnitus but not just the braces.

It seems from the history that you are having viral conjunctivitis involving both the eyes. Coming to your first question, viral conjunctivitis remains infective in the initial three to five days hence no need to worry about the reinfection from the one eye that is still healing. Usually, viral conjunctivitis follows a self-limiting course of 7 to 10 days. Since you are having vision problems in the eye, probably it has involved cornea resulting in viral keratoconjunctivitis.  If it has involved the cornea, it takes about three to four weeks to heal. However, the involvement of cornea is not because of infection, but because of immunologically mediated reaction, hence it will resolve even without treatment. However, symptomatic relief can be obtained by using artificial tears, and some severe cases may require the use of steroid eye  ChatDoctor.

Warts and molluscum are common sexually acquired infections and can occur in healthy individuals. Warts spread by touch and condoms will only protect the covered area.

Apply it over the affected area thrice a week and leave it overnight and wash in the morning. Use it for 16 weeks.

{"chat": [{"input": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello doctor,You were wonderful in allaying some health anxiety over some skin issues several months ago. So, I thought I would consult with you on another question pertaining to my son. Unfortunately, a combination of my health anxiety and the big mistake of searching online has my mind imagining the worst with regard to my son. My son is 19 years old and has no diagnosed medical issues. I noticed back when he was about eight or ten years old that he had a mark resembling a cafe au lait mark on his back, in the upper shoulder area. I had always asked the pediatrician to look at it during his yearly physicals, and they made nothing of it. Throughout the years it has grown a bit and has become darker and more rough in texture. It is probably slightly less than an inch in length and looks like a few small lesions grouped together. Again, I have brought it to the pediatrician\\s attention and he was not concerned. Three months ago, I made an appointment for him and my other son with a dermatologist for a skin exam, and I pointed out the spots which I wanted to be checked in particular. We met with the physician\\s assistant there, and my younger son had a peculiar spot I pointed out, of which the PA conducted a shave biopsy, which came back as a mildly atypical junctional nevus. For my older son, I pointed out the spot on his back/shoulder, and the PA diagnosed it as a linear epidermal nevus. She said the chances of it becoming dangerous are slim to none. It may darken throughout the years, and they will simply monitor it at yearly visits. Unfortunately, I went on to research online about epidermal nevi and of course I ran into information showing a possible link to epidermal nevus syndrome and all of its associated neurological and skeletal defects. As I said, he is 19 and has no medical issues, is extremely intelligent, etc. In your opinion, is it safe to say that I should not be concerned about those syndromes? I presume it is primarily related to the numerous and systemic epidermal nevi, which he does not have, and I would think it would have presented by now? And my last even more neurotic question. My online research led me to some information saying that a certain type of epidermal nevus could be related to a gene mutation that could be passed along to an offspring, with them having possible serious skin scaling conditions, etc. Again, he has just one solitary small epidermal nevus. No biopsy was done, as the PA did not feel it was necessary. Do you feel there is any need for me to worry about that potential genetic mutation? Thank you so much for reading my long query."}], "ideal": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. A solitary epidermal nevus is very common and does not pose any kind of serious health concern. Neither is a biopsy required. You are right. Any associated symptom should have been present since birth or early childhood in this case. Even if it is passed on to the future generations, it is harmless. A yearly medical examination is more than enough for the nevi in both your kids. Good luck. "}]}

From your description, I understand that the first time you had a problem with your left leg was due to a sprain (talofibular ligament) around the ankle and it got resolved. I suspect the same problem or something similar is causing you the pain again. It is highly unlikely for a 33 year old lady and a non-smoker to have a peripheral vascular disease. The arterial Doppler did show a decreased blood flow, but it might be due to a temporary spasm of the vessel than any specific pathology or disease. Moreover, no clot was found nor was there any change suggesting peripheral vascular disease. It is absolutely safe to fly and you need not worry about it. An arterial Doppler will be able to make out if you have a clot. D-dimer test is only for the veins and is not useful in arterial disease. I suggest you to look for causes either in your footwear or any strain which you have put repeatedly on your ankle causing repeated sprain in the left ankle. You can get an orthopedic consultation to be sure of the same. If he or she does not find any problem and your pain persists even after appropriate treatment then further evaluation can be done by a vascular surgeon. But, I do feel you may not require it. "}]}

It seems it is the result of the trauma you have had two years ago. Muscle or spine bone damage may have occurred. That can be understood doing a MRI examination of your spine. Anyway if that does not happen often, there is no any specific treatment you can take about that. Just take any painkiller when you feel pain (Ibuprofen) and nothing more. Avoid weight lifting or hard physical activity. Avoid long time standings. If you are overweight, lose some kilograms. You can do some light spine exercises or physiotherapy to remove pain and numbness of your back. If no improvement, then see a neurologist for further assistance. Take care and best wishes. "}]}

Small amount of fluid is expected near posterior cul de sac and para adnexal area during ovulation time. Although it can be seen during pelvic inflammatory disease. Multiple follicle grow every month in both the ovaries which later on is dominated by a single follicle which continues to grow to a certain size, and later ruptures releasing the egg. So your 6 mm and 15 mm follicles are normal to be there. Without doing a histopathological examination, it is difficult to tell about the origin of the thick septation but as most of the ovarian cysts are epitheleal in origin, so 90 % chances are they are made of some kind of epitheleal tissue. Any kind of debris inside the cyst will give rise to echogenicity in USG. It could be blood, it could be tissues of different origin. There are different types of ovarian cyst, to rule out malignancy you need to do certain tumor markers like CA 125, etc., and MRI or CT scan. Since it is receding in size, my best guess that your cyst is some kind of retention cyst of ovary. There is a large possibility that the cyst will regress soon. I think your cyst is an incidental finding as you have stated there is minimal symptom. Your gynecologist will be the best person to advise you in this matter.

I have reviewed your health query and can well understand you are worried about your heart health. I would not say to stop Xarelto (Rivaroxaban) and/or Cordarone (Amiodarone) as these are very important medications and you need them. For stent patients, Xarelto reduces the risk of strokes, pulmonary embolism, and deep venous thrombosis, and clots initiating from the stents area. It is a blood thinning agent and keeps the blood running in veins and arteries without excessive clotting. Cordarone, on the other hand, keeps you away from heart rhythm problems like AF (atrial fibrillation). With the fact that you are having no arrhythmias while taking this medication, I do not think there is an obvious need to change the dosage. If your cardiologist gets some indication to reduce the dosage after examining you physically, that would be a different story.

It means that your immune system is sensitised to that allergen and that an allergy can occur in subsequent exposures to the allergen.

The reports mentioned on ECG are machine generated and are frequently inaccurate. There is no clear-cut evidence of myocardial infarction on ECG. As you also do not have any history of chest pain, it is unlikely for you to have any heart attack. And yes, heart rate is low and it is sinus bradycardia. Do you have any symptoms of dizziness, syncope, etc? If not then it needs no action at the moment. However, you should undergo thyroid test to rule out hypothyroidism as a cause for low heart rate. Also, should undergo echo, which will additionally provide the assurance to rule out MI. Also, if echo is normal then should have TMT (treadmill test), which will help in ruling out minor blockages, subclinical ischemic heart disease and to look for maximum heart rate you achieve during exercise, which will help in determining the benign nature of sinus bradycardia if the adequate heart rate is achieved. Also, high bp can also cause low heart rate by a reflex mechanism. So you should have medicine for it. I guess you are not receiving any medicines like beta blockers which can reduce heart rate. You should have tablet Telma CTD (Telmisartan and Chlorthalidone) 40/12.5 mg once a day in the morning for hypertension so get it prescribed by a local doctor.

Just for general knowledge, signs, and symptoms of low testosterone include a change in sleep patterns that may be insomnia or sleep pattern disturbances. Physical changes like increased body fat and reduced muscle mass or bulk. Sexual changes like reduced sexual desire, sexual dysfunction, or infertility. Emotional changes like decreased motivation, depression, lethargic. Worsening of sleep apnea if a patient already has it or if there are risk factors the patient will get sleep apnea possibly. Worsening of congestive heart failure in cardiac patients. Many of your symptoms overlap with low-T. You need further probing in this matter. Your treating physician would help you in this regard. Sometimes diabetes, infections, obesity or other factors may contribute to ending up with low-T. Your physician would rule them out for you.  "}]}

So go for it as soon as the situation in your area gets better. For now, take Amoxicillin clavulanate 500 mg (thrice daily) for five days, Paracetamol 500 mg to thrice daily SOS. Do not take Paracetamol when there is no pain but do complete the Amoxicillin course. Additionally, you can take any one for gastritis if you have a tendency to develop gastritis with antibiotics. You can take PAN-D (Pantoprazole) or Omez (Omeprazole). Take them on empty stomach. Do salt water rinse regularly. You can apply clove oil at the site, it is a good anti-inflammatory. Maintain good oral hygiene regularly, but for sure get it treated. Avoid eating from the affected side until it gets treated or even if you eat make sure nothing gets lodged in that tooth. Do mouth rinses with plain water regularly so that there is no food stuck.  ChatDoctor.  I hope this helps. "}]}

Based on the dates given by you, today must be 8 days following the date of the intercourse.

For the urine pregnancy tests to show the result if pregnant, it must be at least 10 to 14 days following intercourse. If you want to know urgently whether you are pregnant, you can get serum beta hCG testing. If you can wait another week, you can get a urine pregnancy testing, which if positive must be followed up by ultrasound imaging.

{"chat": [{"input": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi doctor,I am a 23 year old male, a third-year medical student. For the past seven days, I have had an increased urgency and frequency to urinate. I can go even more than 30 times a day - majority of these times, I feel an increased urgency. However, when I go, only a small amount or drops come out. For the past two to three days, the urgency kind of feels to be getting worse, I feel as if I will not be able to hold it. However, I am still able to as there is no leaking. There is no burning or irritation or any discharge. No recent sexual encounters and no other associated symptoms. I take Coveram 10/10 for essential hypertension and Valdoxan 25 because I also do suffer from anxiety. I have been under stress lately as I was doing my exams this past week and finished today. I have done a few tests at my family doctor: Last week I did a dipstick which was normal apart from +1 protein. Voiding bladder US was normal (450 mL pre voiding, 45 mL post voiding). An initial urine culture was normal according to my doctor. Yesterday, I performed another dipstick and urine culture. The dipstick was normal, and early urine microscopy showed 10 to 100 white cell count. We are waiting for the cultures to return. Due to the result of the white cell count, my doctor said it would be worth a try to undergo a 5-day course of antibiotics (Keflex).Today is my third day of antibiotic treatment, symptoms are largely the same. Today, I attempted to hold my bladder. It felt fine in the morning but as the day went on, my symptoms returned and I am finding it harder to hold my bladder. Also, for the first time, I tried going for a run. The entire time I felt a heaviness in my bladder and felt a strong urge to urinate, even though I went before my run began. What do you think could be going on? My doctor believes that it is either a UTI, or most likely, a hypersensitive bladder due to exam stress. However, there have been days where I have not felt stress at all yet symptoms have continued. I am really worried as I want to go back to work in five days and I do not think I will be able to manage the way things are at the moment. My family doctor does think this will settle down now that I have finished exams. Do you think there is a chance it could? I have mentioned this query to another doctor online, and he believed it may be due to an overactive bladder. However, since I am relatively young to receive this diagnosis, I wanted a second opinion, if that is alright. Do you think this could be OAB? I am worried that it could be something serious, like multiple sclerosis. One and a half years ago, I had an episode of sudden onset numbness in one arm and fearing the same thing, I ended up having an MRI of my brain and lumbar spine which both came back negative. Do you think this could be MS?"}], "ideal": "Hello. Relax and do not worry. As per your symptoms, it looks like overactive bladder only. Do you have any problem with the flow of urine? Or hesitation?

If you have been regular with your menses these years and this is the first episode at 53 years of age when the menses have been delayed by two weeks, the causes can be a possible initiation of perimenopausal stage where menses are often delayed for a month or two and slowly tend to stop in next one to two years. Perimenopausal stage can be verified with the hormonal FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (Luteinizing hormone) levels which if high shall indicate an onset of perimenopausal stage. However, it is suggested that pregnancy should anyways be ruled out and if negative then you can wait naturally for your menses to resume.

If you have had unprotected sex and have come inside her, and she is in her unsafe period, then the next best step to avoid pregnancy would be for her to opt for an emergency contraceptive pill like an I-pill or an Unwanted 72 pill within 72 hours of intercourse to avoid unplanned pregnancy. You have to understand that even pre-cum, which is ejaculated before the actual ejaculation occurs also contains live active motile sperms, which can also get her pregnant even if you follow the with ChatDoctor.  So chances shall remain unless you ensure pre-cum control as well. The condom size is mentioned on the pack and one can decide that based on his penile length and thickness at full erection. There are standard size condoms available but that is completely user\\s preference. Natural ways like washing with water immediately or wiping with tissues do not help much, but if you can opt for a spermicidal vaginal cream before initiating intercourse mixed with a vaginal lubricant like KY jelly, then chances of pregnancy can be substantially decreased even with an unprotected intercourse episode.

There are many factors, other than tight inner thigh muscles that limit the split especially center split. Bony restriction in the hip joint, as the hip joint bone gets jammed into socket because of extreme coxa vara angle (angulation between the neck and shaft of the thigh bone) leading to restrictions in movement. These jams will not happen when you do a side split as there is slight rotation occurring in the joint and allows the action to happen.  Other reason could be ligamentous (pubofemoral ligament) limitation as the ligament tightens and it limits the further movement. This ligament realigns and will relax while doing forward and side split. So, it will not restrict your movement other than center split.

My doctor told me no need for further tests."}], "ideal": "Hello, Welcome back to ChatDoctor. To answer your query, I want to give reference of published research that, Although the reported sensitivity and specificity of fourth generation tests are more than 99% in numerous studies, there are several instances of discordance between screening and confirmatory techniques (Liu P et al. AIDS Research and Therapy 2016 13:1). False positivity can be due to user error or cross contamination, if there is ongoing some other illness eg. malaria, or if there is a history of blood transfusion, autoimmune diseases. A positive test result always needs to be routinely confirmed using a different type of test or testing kit. Fourth generation tests are more than 95% accurate at six weeks and this needs to be confirmed after three months with a second test. If the test in your case has been performed at three months after the exposure and is giving negative results, and you have not had another risk, you do not have HIV. Your fourth generation test and RNA PCR at 9 and 10 weeks and further 12 weeks negative RNA PCR, suffices to rule out infection. If you still have apprehension, get a repeat HIV antibody test at six months of exposure, no need to repeat it in between. Take precautions in the future (consistent and correct condom usage). I hope this helps. "}]}

In your case surrogate is kell negative it means her body is still not exposed to kell antigens which are good, so this pregnancy will be safe. 2. As the husband is heterozygous, it means he has only a 50 % chance of having baby kell positive. In the rest 50 %, there is no risk of complications. So, theoretically, this pregnancy should go silent without complications.

The growth of the child is two weeks smaller for 38 weeks but corresponding to its ultrasound age, the weight of the baby is fine. There is a likelihood that you may have had an irregularity in your menses earlier and your ovulation may have been delayed and leading to late conception. However, best would be to undertake a biophysical profile and an umbilical artery doppler, MCA Doppler studies (middle cerebral artery) to look for cause for decreased supply to the fetus (if at all). If these parameters are normal, then your dates are probably wrong or you have had delayed ovulation and fertilization because fetus would then be considered growing and pregnancy can be continued and followed up with serial ultrasounds.

For that have to check clinically for any sign of vaginal tear or just bleeding from your uterus. If you have a doubt that last month had sex and can be pregnant, then do a urine pregnancy test. If negative, then you are not pregnant and it was either your period or bleeding due to masturbation. Cramping also can be due to your menstruation, as it may be going on and you will bleed in short time. In case of laceration of the vagina while masturbation also, you will get cramps. If bleeding is not there, then it is difficult to say the cause. But, forget everything and just do a urine pregnancy test in case of doubt. Other things are normal as you are not bleeding now. "}]}

Before the accident, she was fine. But, she may have shown a few signs of slight memory issues and balance prior to the accident as well.

Her cognitive function is a lot worse. She gets very confused about daily items and memory issues.We are looking for supplements to keep her regular and avoid the loose stool episodes.

Respiratory tract infection can also be a cause for having phlegm with blood. A headache and fever will also support the diagnosis. Poking the nose with a finger can also be a cause for having phlegm with blood because blood can pass from the back of the nose to the pharynx.

In addition to bleeding, if your partner has a fever, headache, and cough, then respiratory tract infection will be a probable diagnosis. You can consult a family doctor for evaluation and treatment.

His analogy was; like diabetics, their bodies produce insulin but just does not know what to do with it.So, his treatment recommendation is TRT testosterone replacement therapy along with Clomid.

I have a couple of questions for you: Testosterone resistance is a phenomenon that occurs due to a genetic defect and would have caused problems with puberty and would not appear now in adulthood. Clomid (Clomifene) gave a very good response. I would not advise TRT. The low libido could be due to a variety of other issues and likely not a result of testosterone levels. If the thought is resistance then there would be resistance to exogenous therapy too. Why do we think a chemical would be better than the body's natural testosterone. You are thinking right, eat better. I would recommend reducing animal food consumption which have high sex steroids and these can act as endocrine disrupters.

I will advise to continue with the titration regimen suggested by your prescribing doctor. Do not rush to increase the dose to 150 mg as titration needs to be carefully considered after weighing up your response and any side effects.

After few days of getting my body too much into motion I felt my upper back getting stuck and again was unable to move and the pain radiated to my wrist and hand. Then had bed rest for another 10 days and felt a bit better. But, still in pain and resumed with two to three hours of brisk walking and exercises. I noticed that many joints in my body were making cracking sound while I walk or move my body and they were continuous. They are not going away no matter how much I move that joint, the cracking sound will repeat infinite times whenever I move my body. The cracking sound is mostly from lower and upper back, shoulder, ankle, foot fingers, knees also make that cracking sound and it is painful as well. Cracking sound in knees are felt more when I start walking after being in rest state and frequency of cracking sound reduces after walking for two to three minutes.I got my ESR and CRP checked. They are normal, but there is a slight increase in lymphocytes and RBC. Now, I have been suffering from this continuous cracking sounds and pain in almost all my joints for more than a month now. I also suffer from severe pain in tail bone area. Also suffers from some sensation loss (not persistent) in left side of my upper left leg, pain in groin area (but not anymore), pain in lower back and upper back.

The ideal treatment plan for a split or fractured tooth should be as follows: Now the swelling in the gum and the bad odor is because the tooth got decayed heavily and it is over a year. This is called necrosis similar to a dead tooth. The burning sensation and the white coating on the side of your tongue are because of the rubbing of the tongue over the sharp edges of the tooth.

If your obsessions are bothering you that much, first you need to start medications because the content of your obsessions is a second factor when it comes to treatment, first we need to focus on not having an obsession which will be possible with medication.

His optometrist changed the type of lens after remarking that the lens appeared tight. Although the painful sensations have decreased, they are still present with more of a sore feeling now.

There are so many possibilities which can be responsible for this. Most probably your urinary bladder may fail to empty properly due to weakness of bladder muscle. For this condition, you have to get a USG (ultrasonography) done, where I want the detail about post-void residual volume. It means an ultrasonologist will take scan one before urinating and another after passing the urine in which he will mention the volume of post-void residual urine (PVU). If the volume retention is moderate, then we have to strengthen your pelvic floor muscle with some exercise and believe me it gives an excellent result and I had, treated so many patients with that exercise. Another possibility is decreased blood concentration of ADH (anti-diuretic hormones) which is, responsible for concentrating the urine and lack of this hormone is responsible for frequent urination. The last but not least, I would advise to get your blood sugar level done (both- fasting and two hours after a meal).

So before jumping to conclusion that it is psychological, I would suggest you that further investigation is required such as serum testosterone, serum LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone). You may also need sonography of testes and visualization of the duct to see if they are blocked or not and also prostate if it is enlarged or not. Most often psychological anejaculation is situational and not permanent or complete, while you mentioned that you never had it. So I recommend that you consult a urologist for your symptoms and get investigated properly to find the cause of your problem. It is a treatable condition and can be treated accordingly. If the investigation comes normal then you can think that this is due to psychological in origin. Then counseling and sex therapy will be helpful.

The increase of the dose of Zoloft (Sertraline) can cause sleep problem, as you are facing currently. To manage this, you can change the time from night to morning or afternoon. If you altogether stop night doses of Zoloft (return back to 100 mg per day), then this sleep issue will me resolve within four to five days. Another way to manage sleep is to take Seroquel (Quetiapine) 25 mg in morning and 50 mg at night time. By this, your sleep will be normal as Seroquel has sedative property.

I am a 47-year-old unmarried, not-sexually active, uncircumcised male, 5'10\\x80\\x9d, 190 pounds. I have a history of ulcerative colitis (which seems to be hereditary). This was corrected 12 years back when I received a total colectomy and pouch replacement (that is bowel removed, and new bowel constructed out of small intestine). That seems all good. For some time (five years), I have experienced a very slight pain or irritation at the base of the glans of my penis. Friction (eg., masturbation) would make it sore, but it was very slight. Some redness in the skin just below the glans, but not always. Did not even consider this a problem (and it might not be the problem, I am just mentioning it).Six months back the glans of my penis became inflamed. This was the start of my problems. No bumps, no itchiness, no scaling skin. Just redness on the bottom half of the glans, and also the tip. It got very sore. If it was never touched, it does not hurt at all. However, it rubs the underwear during the day, and that can be very painful. Not always, but most of the time. The pain can be excruciating. I want to emphasize that the rash has never been itchy. Urinating causes no pain. I consulted my family physician and he did not know what it was but said he could treat it like a yeast infection. So he prescribed some antifungal cream with 1 % Hydrocortisone (Clotrimaderm) and when that did not do anything, suggested the 1 % HC might be getting in the way, so prescribed straight anti-fungal over the counter anti-fungal cream (all the creams I have used twice a day). No help. The 1 % HC did relieve some (a little) of the pain but did not actually fix anything.Thinking maybe the problem was not fungal, but perhaps bacterial, my doctor then prescribed Polysporin ointment. I quite by accident bought the version of Polysporin with Lidocaine. The Polysporin also did not fix the problem, but the Lidocaine brought some relief! The pain was lessened, but as I said, the problem was not fixed. I used Lidocaine for two weeks before going back to the doctor to let him know the problem remained. He then recommended a urologist, so I got a referral to a urologist. The urologist did not know what it was but suggested two possibilities: go see a dermatologist or get a circumcision. My family doctor did not think the circumcision would help, so he referred me to a dermatologist. The dermatologist said the rash was non-contagious and non-cancerous. He prescribed me four creams which I was to try, in sequence one at a time, for a week at a time, and let him know which helped. They were Ketoderm 2 %, Fucidin 2 %, Noritate 1 %, and Hydroval. I tried each of these as directed. None of these helped. The ones with some HC 1 % relieved some of the pain, but the rash is currently as bad or worse than when the problem started. The dermatologist said there was nothing else he could do, and recommended I get another appointment with a different urologist. The dermatologist did a swab and sent it to the lab, and it came back negative. He also had earlier said it was not an STI.As you can imagine, I am not very encouraged.

His right leg could not carry the weight of his body. He is approx 110 kg, 6 feet tall. He has had this problem for the last 30 years but he had never been bedridden and the medication worked. He is also diabetic, taking medication for the heart - Eliquis 2.5 mg to reduce the risk of formation of blood clots and he also has varicose veins.On the first day after this started, he took medication himself as per his last prescription. It did not work and after four days, we called the same doctor home who prescribed Insulin, Zocef CV 500 twice 10 days, Levoflox 500 one a day for 10 days and Daflon twice for 15 days. He said to give it nine days before a follow-up.However, after five days since there was no relief and it had started oozing or edema which he noticed when he was sitting up when two visitors came over. The next day, we called another doctor, a diabetologist, as the previous doctor, then said to visit a vascular surgeon as he could not do anything about the oozing. This doctor completely changed the medicines prescribing Linospan 600 twice, Ceftum 500 twice, Chymoral Forte twice along with two other ointments Nadoxin and Betadine and dressing the wounds. This gave immediate relief. He continued the medication for two weeks till the next follow by the same doctor.By this time, the wounds (characterized by oozing, discoloration, swelling) had completely healed except a small hole at the ankle. This time, the doctor prescribed Doxy 100 twice for two weeks and Orni O twice for seven days along with the same ointments.

He needs to be seen by a podiatric surgeon, or a surgeon who deals with foot care.  Being an elderly diabetic with limb swelling, it is always safe to get a Doppler (both arterial and venous) of the limbs done.

Venous Doppler rules out varicose veins (which he already has) and also deep vein thrombosis (obstruction of deep veins which is dangerous). This can change the current line of management. Antibiotics can be stopped if there is no evidence of active infection and proper limb care is given. Some general measures you have to follow: You can add some flow modulators like Trental (Pentoxifylline 400 mg twice daily) which can improve blood flow.

Another cause can be inflammation of the gum flap in that area caused due to food accumulation between the gum flap and the wisdom tooth. For confirmation, a clinical examination and an X-ray is needed. I suggest antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Potassium Clavulanate) and anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen can help.

He currently takes them with caffeine (200 mg of supplement for every 100 mg of caffeine) average of 400 mg L-Theanine a day. Could they become addictive? Does it have any side effects? What more should we know?"}], "ideal": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. L-Theanine is an amino acid synthesized from tea. It helps with reducing stress and anxiety and induces a sense of calmness by increasing serotonin and dopamine in the brain which are the feel-good chemicals. As such, it is a supplement and not a medicine per se, so there are no fixed guidelines issued by any regulatory authorities. Normally people do get relief with 200 to 600 mg. Since it is synthesized from a stimulant (tea) it is advised not to combine with other stimulants like caffeine. It can increase anxiety once the effect of caffeine wears off. Apart from that, there are no side effects as such and not really addictive. If the anxiety issues are troubling, it would be advisable to visit a local psychiatrist and take a short course of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) class of medicines which will help with this problem. Also, consider doing deep breathing exercises or yoga or meditation. "}]}

{"chat": [{"input": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello doctor,I am a 65-year-old white male and tested negative for HIV 1 and 2 in a one-time test three to four years ago. I am not sure if it was a third or fourth generation test. I tested negative with a fourth generation test four months back because I thought I might be having some symptoms. And I remembered the flu-like illness about six months after exposure.I weighed 204 kg three months back and now I weigh 191 kg. I have worried a lot (pacing the floor, sleep loss) for past five months, took Paxil, and realized my worry could account for some weight loss. Shortly, after the test, I had the following symptoms:I started having a small patch of 8 to 10 pinpoint sized pink-light red dots under the skin of my left wrist that have been there for two to three weeks.I also had a smooth, flat spot about 3/8 inch in diameter that appeared on the back of my right hand about a week ago, that has now faded to a pinkish brown. I have read about Kaposi sarcoma being a definer of AIDS, but do not understand how that could happen with a non-reactive fourth generation test four months back.Three months back, I had sinus type headaches multiple times that would sometimes be severe. After three rounds of antibiotics and a CT scan two months back that showed shadowing in a sinus, my ENT doctor just told me this week that there is something in my sphenoid sinus. He is treating it with a rinse for inflammation for three weeks before I see him again. I have had blood in my mucous from my nose for past three months. It dries out in my nose and causes blood almost every time I pick at it. The ENT doctor said that the lining of my nose had been worn down from this, but did not seem concerned about it. I do mess with it a lot, and blow my nose a lot.My PSA elevated quickly in the last six months, going from 1.2 to 3.5. A biopsy two months back showed an early cancer in one of the 12 regions biopsied.I had a lithotripsy on an 8 mm kidney stone this month and I am still passing dark urine. I was told that I do have several small stones still in each kidney. I have had multiple stones over the years.I have a swelling sensation all the way around my waist down into my groin at times that has been there for about two months, but no noticeable swelling. Several doctors have felt in my abdomen and detected nothing abnormal. A CT scan with no contrast 10 days ago showed no abnormalities other than a little swelling in the right kidney where the 8 mm stone was blocking the passage into the ureter. A CT with contrast five months back was normal except for showing stones. But I have microscopic blood in my urine since then.My vital signs have consistently been normal for past five months, including temperature, BP and oxygen. I know I am getting old and some of these symptoms happen with age. But it is driving me crazy that so much has happened since my negative fourth generation test which is supposed to detect antibodies may not be conclusive after three to four years of exposure. I had Zoloft 100 mg daily earlier but currently, on Paxil 40 mg and Propranolol 60 mg daily.After nearly four years of exposure and a negative antibody test four months back, would that test have detected antibodies if I were in a stage of HIV or AIDS? Do you think it was conclusive? Or is there another test I should have done? I have read about an HIV RNA test, but it says early detection. I understand that it detects more than the antibodies. What are your thoughts on my next step?"}], "ideal": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Your test done before four months is certainly conclusive and final. A three months intervening period/window period between risk exposure and a fourth generation HIV screening test is good enough for it to be considered conclusive. 95 % of those infected with HIV will have detectable antibodies by four weeks and by 12 weeks, or three months 100 % of HIV infected individual will have detectable antibodies. Antibodies once formed will remain detectable by screening tests. In fact, antibody based HIV screening tests are the gold standard tests for the diagnosis of infection whereas an HIV RNA PCR test is more commonly utilized as a measure of response to antiretroviral therapy in HIV AIDS patients rather than as a diagnostic or screening test.

A normal sedimentation rate essentially rules out inflammatory pathology. Lupus is an inflammatory disease. To begin with, we need to know more about your symptoms.

My fiance had his parent\\s consent before he got this tattoo. But, young as we are, we are not yet aware of the risks of this unprofessional method of tattooing.

There is a solution to your problem. It is true that unsterile needles used for tattooing can lead to the spread of certain blood-borne infections. HIV virus is quite unstable outside the human body, so it is less likely for the virus to have been active on the needles, but we cannot rule out the chance of him acquiring the infection. HIV virus does not usually show up on blood tests very soon. The best thing to do is to talk to your doctor about the exposure and your fiance can take post-exposure prophylaxis. Some medicines will be given that will help to prevent infection in people who might have been exposed to the virus. There may be a risk of other blood-borne infections like hepatitis B, hepatitis C, tuberculosis or Staphylococcus aureus. These can be prevented by taking appropriate treatment.

If you have had a gastrointestinal infection, and if your lipstick came in contact with your saliva, the microbes could have gone into the lipstick. How long they survive in the lipstick, and how fast they multiply, largely depends on what kind of chemicals were used in the making of the lipstick. Moreover, different microbes need different kinds of growth environment, so it is hard to comment on that. I would advise you to avoid using cosmetics when you are sick. Regarding sharing of your lipstick, it is never a great idea to share your cosmetics with others. Cosmetics should be used as personal items, just like you would use your toothbrush. Sharing cosmetics can lead to the spread of skin infections. If you think you have shared cosmetics with someone you think might have some kind of infection, I would advise you to dispose it, and buy something new. I hope this helps.  Take care."}]}

Ideally, you should collect the courage to tell your problem to parents because you are still very young. If not comfortable with parents some close relative or friend or free helpline. Making the diagnosis of depression, the symptoms must present for at least two weeks regularly. Sometimes we see someone close to us suffering from any disease and try to find or check yourself for these symptoms, remain anxious with their thought, later that thought can lead to depression. One more easy way to decide is to ask yourself whether normal functioning is hampered. If the answer is yes you should go to a psychiatrist as early as possible. Again saying that taking help from the parent is the best option in front of you. Do not be afraid of the treatment. It is very simple and easy to treat depression nowadays. "}]}

It all started with itchy scalp ten months back this summer. But, I was not concerned much, since it was just itchy and some bumps like mosquito bites (not more than two to three) and some swelling as well. Since it was summer, I was sweating. Sometimes, the whole scalp would itch and sometimes only the bumps. It continued for some months. Later, itching of the scalp subsided and bumps size has decreased. But since three to four months, I can feel pimple like things on my scalp and they ache sometimes. When they started, they would disappear on their own in less than a week. But now, even after so many months, I can feel some more (not more than two at a time) pimples. I doubt whether it could be folliculitis. I have not had a haircut since ten months, just because I thought the itching could be contagious. So, I better not go for a haircut and spread it to others. There are two to three bumps on my face as well. One was hurting earlier, but it is all itchy and the other two are only itchy. I would like to state it again that they do not itch all the time and one that aches do not hurt at all the time. Also, I felt a pimple like thing on my butt. It disappeared in a week. It was not very painful. I have had folliculitis till I was 25. So, I know how much it pains and itches. I thought it could be folliculitis.

They come and go and they appeared on my face only after that. We are a family of four. I have OCD as well and cannot tolerate these skin diseases.

You both have the same blood group and can conceive without any fear. There is no worry regarding same blood group.  The point that should be kept in mind is if your wife has a negative group and the child is Rh positive, then to prevent hemolysis in the second child, an anti-D injection is given. It is good that you are alert regarding pre-conception counseling. You and your wife need to do CBC (complete blood count) with PS (peripheral smear). I am advising this because if there are microcytic hypochromic red blood cells and the RBC mass is high, then HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) should be done to rule out hemoglobinopathy, especially thalassemia minor. If you both are thalassemia minor, then fetus amniocentesis needs to be done to rule out thalassemia major in the baby. Take care. Hope your concern is solved. "}]}

My advice to you is: 1. Since you have been detected to have optic disc asymmetry, kindly follow up with your ophthalmologist every six months or as instructed by him or her. You may also be offered additional testing to confirm if your disc asymmetry needs to be treated or if it should just be monitored. 2.

I had gone through your query. So as ablation can prevent AF (atrial fibrillation) but the return of atrial size to normal is unlikely. The risk due to atrial dilation in AF is due to the formation of blood clots inside left atrial appendage and chance of embolism producing a stroke. We normally perform transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out the presence of thrombus before considering for DCC (direct current cardioversion). So if the size is more than 4.5 cms and some consider more than 5.5 cms there is a need for anticoagulation (blood thinners) to prevent thte stroke.

You have also sinusitis associated with it. Polyps are usually removed surgically.

In general, without the MRI, I suspect this to be a muscle injury, which is healing slowly. As MRI too have limitations, we have to follow the clinical signs and symptoms and treat according to the clinical symptoms. This sounds to me as a muscle injury, due to which there is a muscle imbalance. I will advise undergoing muscle re-education, and muscle balance board training, which can help correct the actual action of the muscle and a proper torque can be applied with the contraction of the muscles. Later a graded practice of the lower limb will be good. If the nature of the pain is burning, tingling, radiating, and numbing, etc., that we may have to look out for any nerve root entrapment and treat accordingly.

You should get yourself investigated for the blackouts and memory problems you face. First, you should consult a neurologist for that. Once every other neurological issue are cleared, then only we can diagnose whether it as related to your anxiety, depression or PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) if so then it is psychogenic. In most cases, a psychogenic blackout is an involuntary reaction of the brain to pressure or distress. Psychogenic blackouts sometimes develop after people have experienced ill-treatment or trauma and such conditions are treatable and curable. But we need to identify the severity of anxiety and PTSD and then the treatment slowly starts with medicines, psychotherapy and relaxation therapy.

The numbness in your small finger is related to a pinched nerve in the elbow, probably related to a wrong position during sleeping. It is not related to the bulging disc in the lumbar vertebral column. I would just recommend performing a nerve conduction study if the numbness persists. In the meantime, I would recommend avoiding pressure on the elbow during sleeping or on the desk. For more information consult a neurologist online "}]}

Your symptoms are not suggestive of cancer. It is a spinal cause which is causing the symptoms (spondylosis). The points which favor for the spinal cause is the long duration of symptoms, your sitting job, worsening as the day progresses, knot-like feeling and radiation to the chest (due to nerve compression). Malignancy will not stay for an extended period without causing any symptoms, and prolonged survival is not possible. With the absence of symptoms, it is too premature to consider it as malignancy. Usually, most of the lesions found incidentally on the chest X-ray are benign as they may indicate a fibrotic lesion of the old healed infection either clinical or subclinical. Also, your doctor has already seen it, and it reduces the chances of having a malignancy in you as they will have some features.

You need neck physiotherapy, including traction and cervical belt which is better starting after MRI. Also, you should use local Diclofenac gel for the pain relief. Hot water fomentation can be done.

Well, we would be able to help you the most if you are able to provide us with a clinical photograph of your condition. Based on the brief history you have provided to us, you seem to be suffering from Lip-lick cheilitis induced post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. In simple words, your habit of licking lips too often in childhood made the skin surrounding the lips (called vermillion border of the lips) too sensitive that it developed red lines and made it vulnerable to sun-induced pigmentation. One episode of having stayed out may have resulted in the tanning of the sensitive lip area resulting in pigmentation. To prevent it from becoming darker, you should immediately start using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 40+ at least twice a day, every day, irrespective of your outdoor exposure. I am sure you will be able to procure a sunscreen from the pharmacy. For further details about ideal sun protection, you may read the sun protection information posted on our website. Additionally, use a good moisturizer over the lip and surrounding skin at least twice a day. To reduce the established pigmentation, a mild depigmenting cream may be needed. However, to suggest the ideal depigmenting cream for your condition, I would need to see the photograph of your pigmentation. "}]}

Blood in stool is not a normal condition as you are having the problem for one year. It should be investigated in detail and the following work-up will be useful. Rectal, anal area examination, stool routine microscopic examination, proctoscopy examination, colonoscopy, if needed. If needed during colonoscopy, biopsy taken from the abnormal area if found for histopathology examination. This work-up will be helpful to rule out causes for blood in stool like a polyp, proctitis, piles, colitis, diverticulitis, any growth, if present, etc. If the color of blood in stool is of brown-red color than bleeding is from the upper gastrointestinal tract. If colour is bright red then the cause for bleeding is from the lower gastrointestinal tract. So, from your provided history, this work-up should be done and above causes should be ruled out. One diagnosis cannot be given. Consult general surgeon or gastroenterologist for examination and above work up and according to cause identified further treatment plan can be decided. "}]}

There seems to be a deep breath one takes similar to when one is at the doctor and they say take a deep breath and then there is a much more satisfying deep breath one can take which seems to fill the upper lungs with much more air. It looks like the diaphragm (upper belly) moves out a little bit when this deep breath happens. Can anyone explain the mechanics of this? Why can this deep breath happen sometimes and not other times? It is as if I could hold a musical note for 3 minutes because their is so much O2 in my lungs."}], "ideal": "Hi. It is an interesting question. Your observation that sometimes you can take a deep breath that is a bit more satisfying than other times makes me a bit more curious as to whether you are in the same posture every time you try it. The diaphragm is a muscle that divides everything in chest from everything in the belly with a few orifices that help get certain things like your food pipe through. It helps to expand the lungs by moving towards the belly while to take a breath in thereby creating more space for the lungs. Since there is a finite potential space, I wonder if you feel the difference based on how much food you have had or what time of day is it. I suggest a more detailed discussion if you can provide some more information. "}]}

Are sociopaths and psychopaths developed the same way? What kind of environment is the most likely to form psychopaths? Are psychopaths more self-sufficient compared to an average person? If psychopaths are unable to feel strong emotions, what are their goals or aspirations in life? What are the signs of a psychopath targeting you?

If a psychopath is able to form a family, what would be the effect on his or her children?"}], "ideal": "Hi. I would be happy to help you. What you are referring to as a psychopath is known as antisocial personality disorder in psychiatry. It is diagnosed using certain standard guidelines and criteria. These people show a persistent disregard for laws and the rights of others. Such people do not generally seek professional help unless it is for comorbid problems like substance use or mood disorder or they are in prison and brought by the police. These people have impulsive traits and extreme irritability which can be reduced with the help of psychiatric medication. Therapy may be helpful but more often than not. There is no permanent treatment because many of them do not follow up and majority do not feel there is anything wrong with them. People who have first degree relatives with psychopathy have higher chances of the same but social, economic and cultural factors also play a role. Sociopaths can be best described as a milder form of antisocial personality disorder. Psychopaths are highly intelligent but they lack empathy. So they do not generally have long lasting relationships or gain satisfaction from interpersonal relations.  Take care."}]}

Firstly, the pain in your lower left tooth could be due to a couple of reasons. Whenever there is infection of the pulp, the infection spreads beyond the tip of the tooth; it extrudes the tooth out of its socket within the jaw. When this happens the tooth is painful especially when it touches the opposing upper tooth. The other reason for tooth pain could be that the entire infected pulp was not removed. Either way, you need to go back to your dentist. The second issue here is the numbness of your chin and lower lip. This usually happens when the nerve in the lower jaw gets nicked by the needle while giving the local anesthetic.

Let me tell you one thing. The implants are usually measured by three things, the volume, the base diameter and the height (profile).

It depends upon the surgeon that what volume will be good in your case. Again the material and shape of the implant determine the distribution of the additional fill.

Although bypass or angioplasty can be done in old age, if the health of patient is promising, but if other health issues are present then it becomes a high risk case. As your mother\\s kidney function is poor, it becomes very risky to have an angiogram done because even non-ionic contrast medium is detrimental for the kidneys. One possibility is that have her 1 or 2 sessions of dialysis done first, then go for angiography and angioplasty and again have one or more sessions of dialysis in close liaison with good nephrologist. If this is done safely, then next risk is of bleeding. After angioplasty, blood thinning medicines are given for long time, this may cause bleeding problem in old age. Regarding bypass, it is a major surgery and needs general anesthesia, although not impossible in old age but, it depends upon overall health and organ functions of body. Cardiac anesthetist will fully evaluate her before bypass. Third option is to keep her on medicines only without going for any intervention. In my opinion, consult a nephrologist that is there any chance of recovery of kidney function, if no then periprocedural dialysis can be considered. "}]}

Also, what is the difference between heterogeneous and homogeneous ovarian cysts?"}], "ideal": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. First of all, 1.5 cm and 1.4 cm are a very small size for a cyst. Because, in every cycle around ovulation one of your ovary makes around 3 cm follicle (cyst). In a sonography, if it looks clear without any shadow in the cyst, then it is homogeneous and when something is found floating in the cyst as echoes (shadow), then it is called heterogeneous. Homogeneous have clear fluid. In heterogeneous cyst, the shadow may be due to blood, pus cells, epithelial cells, other debris, hormones, enzymes or turbid fluid.  In 1.5 cm and 1.4 cm sized small cysts, it is not so much important that whether it is heterogeneous or homogeneous because it is mostly going to disappear around your period. Before ovulation, mostly follicles are with clear fluid. After ovulation, it may be homogeneous or heterogeneous with decreased size. Actually, it looks like disappearing follicle and not a cyst. A cyst can disturb your cycle only if it is of a bigger size and remains even after menstruation. Mostly it begins from unruptured follicle during ovulation and the size can be from 4 cm to 11 cm or even bigger in some case. This type of cyst requires treatment. "}]}

Basically, getting implants is a surgical procedure where the dentist would be putting an implant in your bone through a small surgery under local anesthesia. After that you will have to wait for a few months for the implant to osseointegrate inside the bone means it will adapt itself inside the bone like the natural root. After that, there will be a second stage surgery, a very small procedure. After a few months, you will be getting the crown or the artificial tooth permanently. But before all of this, you need to get your bridge out, the teeth will not be removed with the bridge. For more information consult a dentist online "}]}

Would it not then be too late? Should I push for cranial sonography or MRI?"}], "ideal": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The mark on eyebrow may be some superficial injury. Your kid is not having any symptom of deep brain injury. Your kid was back to play shortly after an injury. Did she have any headache or vomiting or weakness of one side of body or seizure? If not, she is unlikely to have any internal brain injury.Slight bleed inside brain/ small undisplaced fracture heal spontaneously and in the long term may or may not cause a seizure. Might be you are a very anxious mom. If you are much worried, you can go for MRI brain, if it comes out to be normal, your anxiety level will decrease.

A week after this, I started having gas in my stomach and feeling strange and this continues till today. Ten days after this exposure and after I drank a liter of milk, I had diarrhea. The next day I ate, 20 minutes later I went to the toilet. Since then, I did not have such problem but whenever I am eating something I have this feeling that I need to go to the toilet and my stomach is \"playing all over.\" But, I did not have any symptoms of diarrhea. Also, I never had a fever during this period.Five days ago, I started having a headache and my nose was full and I was coughing like I had a kind of virus and I did not know if it was correlated with my symptoms in my stomach. I still have the feeling that I need to go to the toilet but when I go, it is either the gas or the normal stool.

My worries are if I have been infected with HIV by performing fingering and only that, and if my symptoms are related to that and if not what else might be. I am going today to give a sample of my stool for culture to see if I have any virus or anything else. In two weeks from today, my wife and I have decided to do an in vitro fertilization and therefore I am worried if the above are interlinked and I need to take any other action.Finally, my other question is linked to the latter. If I will take any antibiotics now for my stomach if they find also something in my stool and in two weeks, I need to give semen for the in vitro fertilization is this fine or the antibiotics will affect the quality of the semen? Should I do anything else with reference to my possible exposure to fingering?"}], "ideal": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. There is really no chance of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection through just fingering the vagina as the virus is unable to pass through intact skin. There is not even a need to screen for HIV if fingering is the only physical activity that you have performed. Your stomach issues are perhaps due to indigestion and lactose intolerance. Milk and dairy products are a common cause of lactose intolerance. You can avoid dairy products for a while. I do not see any issues with your scheduled IVF (in vitro fertilization) procedure.

This assay can also be used to resolve indeterminate HIV-1 antibody assay results, and to test for HIV-1 infection in patients less than 2 years old. When a fourth generation HIV multi-test screening and diagnostic algorithm is used, if the test results include a repeatedly reactive HIV-1/2 antigen/antibody (fourth generation) screen, followed by negative confirmatory tests for HIV-1 and 2 antibodies and HIV-1 RNA by TMA, the most likely interpretation is a non-specific (biological false positive) reaction in the fourth generation screening assay. There is no current laboratory evidence of HIV infection. Repeat testing on a second specimen is not generally indicated but may be appropriate if there are known risk factors for recent HIV exposure. If the recent HIV-2 infection is suspected, additional testing by HIV-2 DNA or RNA, qualitative, real-time PCR should also be considered. Can someone explain this to me?"}], "ideal": "Hi. HIV RNA PCR test is accurate after 9 to 13 days after the risk exposure. It can be used to detect early infection with HIV when most other screening tests are not yet reliable. However, it is not a confirmatory test and an early screening with RNA PCR should be followed by a more sensitive and specific screening test, this is the fourth generation antigen-antibody HIV screening test at four weeks and at 12 weeks. Therefore, RNA PCR is quite useful in the detection of early infection. Other times this test can be useful as a second test after an indeterminate fourth generation HIV screening test or when a positive HIV screening test is followed by a negative confirmatory test (usually a western blot). In the second scenario, if RNA PCR turns up as negative then it suggests that an earlier positive screening test was most likely a false positive.  "}]}

I do not want that to be changed.Thanks for your time."}], "ideal": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I can understand your concern. 1 & 2. A lot of individuals have the habit of procrastinating. If there are no other associated symptoms, we cannot label this as psychological. You have mentioned that you have low self-esteem and you think a lot about past. Sometimes, you feel worthless and these symptoms might be associated symptoms. Delaying anything without any reason could be due to lack of motivation, initiative or judgment. This should be properly evaluated. This might be due to underlying mood disturbance. Mild depression can cause similar presentation. If there are no such symptoms and you just have the issue of procrastination, then this is not an alarming thing. Try to remain relaxed, make a proper routine of your day to day activities and follow that routine. This will help improve the functioning. Once you are engaged in your routine, the problem of feeling worthless will also go. Try to get pleasure by finishing the work on time and this will motivate you to do more and ultimately the worthlessness symptoms will go. 3. You have mentioned that your husband is an awesome guy and is emotionally very supportive. But, one issue is that he is not very interested in sex. If he has low interest in sex but during sex, if he is getting good erections, then I do not think there is a problem of low testosterone. I hope he is not overweight and has mesomorphic build. In obese individuals, low testosterone could cause problems. Still, to get a clear picture, you can talk with him and get his serum testosterone and prolactin levels done. This will rule out any hormonal cause. Testosterone injections are given for hypogonadism and this will improve the libido and erection of individual. You can give him herbal medicines containing supplements like L-arginine and yohimbine. Both these supplements will increase his libido and erection. You can find these in supplements stores.

The commonest cause for twitches is simple worry or anxiety. I know at least 100 individuals with anxiety, who presented with simple twitches and no other symptoms. In my opinion, you need to see whether these twitches have any relationship with your anxiety level. The another common conditions which present with twitches is endocrine abnormalities, such as thyroid and parathyroid disorders. In case the stress level is not able to explain the twitches, an evaluation for endocrine abnormality is indicated. The list may go on in a similar fashion.

After sometime start the stimulation again and repeat the procedure. Over few months you will gradually increase your ejaculation time.

It is better to obtain echo is not done recently. Also, better to get one stress test like treadmill test or stress echo. BP spike may be age-related combined with panic or anxiety, so you should have BP apparatus at home and monitor it frequently, at least thrice a day for a week. And if most of the BP readings are above 140/90 mmHg then you should have regular medicines for it. You should take low salt diet and do regular exercises as well. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts. "}]}

The reports you have uploaded (attachment removed to protect patient identity) are fine. But, you should upload the echo reports and the fluid investigations as well. Now, considering the pericardial effusion with multiple cardiac tumors, the possibilities of a rhabdomyoma or a teratoma are high. However, an effusion is not common with rhabdomyoma. It is possible to have some other cause for the effusion and it can also be as a result of a heart failure. Both of these are benign tumors. However, at this stage, we cannot rule out a malignancy. The next thing to be done is that she should undergo a cardiac MRI for further characterization of the lesions, which will give us a diagnosis and also resolve the issue of malignancy. Also, if the fluid is available, it should be tested for ADA (adenosine deaminase) and GeneXpert. She should also undergo a thyroid test. Rhabdomyomas usually occurs in patients with tuberous sclerosis, so she should be adequately examined by the doctor for the same. A definitive treatment is the excision of these tumors surgically.

It is probably as big as a penny but not as round as a penny.

The first thing to be ruled out in amenorrhea or not having menstruation is pregnancy, get a urine pregnancy test done. If there is no possibility of such a thing, then start your hormonal pills and get your menstruation. Amenorrhea could also be due to stress, yet times stay cool. Prolong amenorrhea causes lower abdominal discomfort. If once you get menstruation your symptoms may subside. It could not be ovarian or pancreatic cancer chances are very less. Regarding appendicitis, it is often associated with fever and vomitings and the pain does not subside until the appendix is removed. Sometimes in mild cases, it can be treated with antibiotics. If you are still suspicious get a repeat scan done. "}]}

Some tap water contains low levels of organisms such as bacteria and protozoa, including amoebas that may be safe to swallow because stomach acid kills them.

It is the duty of health department of the country to warn the citizens regarding the use of regular tap water because in some places it may be impure. It should not be generalized. Our body and nose in particular, have tremendous local defense mechanisms against bacteria and they can very well take care of small amounts of bacteria if at all they are present in normal water.

For now I would suggest you to get a full mouth scaling and root planning done if possible in your area, after that follow these:  ChatDoctor.  Avoid things like raw garlic, onion. Take more fresh fruits and vegetables. Chew parsley, it helps. Clean your tongue after you are done with tooth brushing. Floss at least once daily.
