# Knowledge Graph and RAG for Language Models - GraphRAGüï∏Ô∏è

Welcome to the **AI Knowledge Graph Project**, where we're using cutting-edge Graph-based Reasoning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Language Models to organize and extract structured knowledge from unstructured data.

## üîç Project Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building **graph-based knowledge systems** that integrate with **Neo4j** and **LangChain**. By leveraging **knowledge graphs**, we can efficiently retrieve relevant information and provide better context-aware responses using **Language Models** like GPT-4, LLAMA, MISTRAL. The  [dataset](./train_2kchat.jsonl) file is a JSON Lines (jsonl) format dataset containing a collection of conversational or textual data. Each line in the file is a valid JSON object(there is 2000 of them) representing a dialogue turn or textual snippet that will be parsed and fed into the knowledge graph. It is collected from [source](https://www.askadoctor24x7.com/community)

### üìú Features

- **Neo4j Integration**: Build and query a **knowledge graph** using Neo4j to store nodes and relationships.
- **LangChain Integration**: Seamless use of Language Models to interact with the knowledge graph for better information extraction and reasoning.
- **GraphRAG Framework**: Employ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for combining generative AI and knowledge graphs for enhanced retrieval.
- **Visualization**: View your knowledge graph visually to understand the relationships between data entities (like the one above).

## üí° How It Works

This project extracts information from various unstructured text sources, and populates a **knowledge graph** in Neo4j, providing an efficient way to query and generate insights. The graph visualization shows relationships between concepts, making it easier to understand the connections between them.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Neo4j**: Graph database to store knowledge nodes and relationships.
- **LangChain**: Framework for large language models, enabling connection to external tools and retrieval systems.
- **Python**: Primary language for building the backend system.
